mCRL2 is a formal specification language with an associated toolset. The toolset
can be used for modelling, validation and verification of concurrent systems and
protocols. It can be run on Windows, Linux and macOS.

The toolset supports a collection of tools for linearisation, simulation,
state-space exploration and generation and tools to optimise and analyse
specifications. Moreover, state spaces can be manipulated, visualised and
analysed.

The mCRL2 toolset is developed at the department of Mathematics and Computer
Science of the [Technische Universiteit Eindhoven](https://fsa.win.tue.nl/), in
collaboration with the [University of Twente](http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl).

See our [website](https://mcrl2.org) for extensive documentation on the usage of
the toolset and downloads of the release and nightly versions.
