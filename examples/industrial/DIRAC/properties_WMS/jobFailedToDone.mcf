% No transit between two terminating states (Failed to Done)
% The property fails, as exemplified by the trace jobFailedToDone.trc
%
% Currently (December 2011), verifying the property using pbessolve requires
% too much time (> 50 hours) and is very memory-hungry. The violation can be detected
% much faster by specifying a monitor process and searching for the presence of an action 
% using lps2lts.
