 * library for manipulating tree-like data structures. Important features of the
 * ATerm Library are maximal subterm sharing, automatic garbage collection, and
 * an efficient binary exchange format. The purpose of the ATerm++ library is
 * to provide the user with a common C++ interface, and to make the ATerm
 * Library compatible with the C++ Standard Library.
 *
 * These pages contain the reference manual for this library.
