/// \details The streamable aterm format:
///
///          Aterms (and function symbols) are written as packets (with an identifier in the header) and their
///          indices are derived from the number of aterms, resp. symbols, that occur before them in this stream. For each term
///          we first ensure that its arguments and symbol are written to the stream (avoiding duplicates). Then its
///          symbol index followed by a number of indices (depending on the arity) for its argments are written as integers.
///          Packet headers also contain a special value to indicate that the read term should be visible as output as opposed to
///          being only a subterm.
///          The start of the stream is a zero followed by a header and a version and a term with function symbol index zero
///          indicates the end of the stream.
