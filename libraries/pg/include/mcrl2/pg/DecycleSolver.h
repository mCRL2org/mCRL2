/*! A partial solver that efficiently solves cycles controlled by a single
    player.

    Specifically, it removes all i-dominated cycles controlled by player p for
    all values of i and p where i%2 == p, including the vertices in their
    attractor sets, and then calls a general solver to solve the remaining
    subgame.

    This is a generalization of the DeloopSolver, which is limited to detecting
    cycles of length 1. The only downside to using the DecycleSolver is that it
    is slower.
