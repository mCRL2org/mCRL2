/*! \ingroup LiftingStrategies

    This is an implementation of the "Focus List Approach" described in the
    Multi-Core Solver for Parity Games paper.

    It alternates between two phases. In the first phase, it iterates over the
    vertices linearly and puts all vertices that are lifted on a focus list with
    a starting credit. The implementation is delegated to a
    LinearLiftingStrategy instance.

    In the second phase, each node on the focus list is attempted to be lifted;
    if lifting succeeds, the credit for this node is increased linearly, and if
    fails the credit is decreased exponentially. This phase is repeated until the
    focus list is empty or a maximum number of lifting attempts has been
    reached (whichever occurs first).  Then, the algorithm switches back to
    phase 1 to create a new focus list.

    The focus list has a fixed maximum size.  When this size is reached during
    phase 1, the algorithm switches to phase 2.
