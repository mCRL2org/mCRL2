/*! A simple reference counting base class.

    Instances of this class start with an initial reference count of 1 (by
    default), which can be increased or decreased by calling the ref() and
    deref() methods.  When the reference count becomes zero, the object
    is deleted and should not be used anymore.

    It is allowed to delete an object directly (without calling deref())
    provided the caller has the only reference to the object.  In effect, this
    is the same as calling deref(), but supports use cases like putting
    instances into std::auto_ptr wrappers.
