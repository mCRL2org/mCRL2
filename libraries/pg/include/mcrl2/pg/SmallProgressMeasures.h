/*! \ingroup SmallProgressMeasures

    Implements the core of the Small Progress Measures algorithm, which keeps
    track of progress measure vectors, and allows lifting at vertices.

    Note that besides these vectors, it tracks the current lifting strategy and
    (optionally) a statistics object.  All public methods of this class notify
    the lifting strategy whenever vectors change (due to one of the solve..()
    lift..() methods), but only when vertices are lifted through one of the
    solve..() methods, are lifting attempts recording in the statistics object.

    As a result, the lift..() methods can be used to introduce information from
    external sources into the game, without affecting the statistics for updates
    that result from local lifting attempts. These methods are thus used in the
    two-way approach to propagate information from the dual game, and the MPI
    recursive solver.

    Note that this is an abstract base class: subclasses may implement different
    storage formats for the progress measure vectors.
