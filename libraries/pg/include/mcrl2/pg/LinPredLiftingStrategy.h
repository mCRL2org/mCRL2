/*! \ingroup LiftingStrategies

    A lifting strategy that combines the linear and predecessor lifting
    strategies: vertices are lifted in sequential order (like with the linear
    lifting strategy) but after a single pass over all vertices, only those
    vertices which had a successor lifted are (like with the predecessor lifting
    strategy).

    Intended for debugging, as it shouldn't really offer any benefits over
    predecessor lifting using a queue. Its main advantage is that the order in
    which vertices are lifted is more predictable.
