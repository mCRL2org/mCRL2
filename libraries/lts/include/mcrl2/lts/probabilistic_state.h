/** \brief A class that contains a probabilistic state.
    \details A probabilistic state is essentially a sequence
             of pairs of a state and a probability. The probability
             indicates the likelyhood with which that particular
             state can be reached. The sum of all probabilities
             in a probabilistic state is one. 
             Internally, it is either stored as single state, 
             or as a vector of states. 
             When using a probabilistic state, a user should
             be aware which of the two internal representations are used.
             After calling "construct_internal_vector_representation"
             it is guaranteed that the state is stored as a vector,
             and iterators over begin/end, and cbegin/cend can be used.
