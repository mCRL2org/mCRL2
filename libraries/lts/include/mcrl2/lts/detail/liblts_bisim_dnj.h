/// \brief O(m log n)-time branching bisimulation algorithm
///
/// \details This file implements an efficient partition refinement algorithm
/// for labelled transition systems inspired by Groote / Jansen / Keiren / Wijs
/// (2017) and Valmari (2009) to calculate the branching bisimulation classes
/// of a labelled transition system.  Different from the 2017 article, it does
/// not translate the LTS to a Kripke structure, but works on the LTS directly.
/// In this way the memory use can be reduced.  The algorithm is described in
/// the technical report
///
/// David N. Jansen, Jan Friso Groote, Jeroen J.A. Keiren, Anton Wijs: A
/// simpler O(m log n) algorithm for branching bisimilarity on labelled
/// transition systems. https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10824
///
/// Partition refinement means that the algorithm maintains a partition of the
/// state space of the LTS into ``blocks''.  A block contains all states in one
/// or several branching bisimulation equivalence classes.  Blocks are being
/// refined until every block contains exactly one branching bisimulation
/// equivalence class.
///
/// The algorithm divides the non-inert transitions into *action_block-slices.*
/// An action_block-slice contains all transitions with a given action label
/// into one block.  One or more action_block-slices are joined into a *bunch.*
/// Bunches register which blocks have already been stabilised:
///
/// > Invariant:  The blocks are stable under the bunches, i. e. if a block
/// > has a transition in a bunch, then every bottom state in this block has
/// > a transition in this bunch.
///
/// However, if a bunch is non-trivial (i. e., it contains more than one
/// action_block-slice), its slices may split some blocks into finer parts:
/// not all states may have a transition in the same action_block-slice.  So, a
/// refinement step consists of moving one small action_block-slice from a
/// non-trivial bunch to a new bunch and then splitting blocks to restore the
/// Invariant.  Splitting is always done by finding a small subblock and moving
/// the states in that subblock to a new block.  Note that we always handle a
/// small part of some larger unit; that ensures that each state and transition
/// is only touched O(log n) times.
///
/// After splitting blocks, some inert transitions may have become non-inert.
/// These transitions mostly need to be inserted into their own bunch.  Also,
/// some states may have lost all their inert transitions and become new bottom
/// states.  These states need to be handled as well to re-establish the
/// Invariant.
///
/// Overall, we spend time as follows:
/// - Every transition is moved to a new bunch at most
///   log<SUB>2</SUB>(2 * n<SUP>2</SUP>) = 2*log<SUB>2</SUB>(n) + 1 times.
///   Every move leads to O(1) work.
/// - Every state is moved to a new block at most log<SUB>2</SUB>(n) times.
///   Every move leads to work proportional to the number of its incoming and
///   outgoing transitions.
/// - Every state becomes a new bottom state at most once.  When this happens,
///   this  leads  to  work  proportional  to  the  number  of  its  outgoing
///   transitions.
/// When summing this up over all states and transitions, we get that the
/// algorithm spends time in O(m log n), where m is the number of transitions
/// and n ist the number of states.

/// structure that can be used for the partition refinement algorithm.

/// Basically, transitions are stored in four arrays:
/// - `pred`: transitions grouped by goal state, to allow finding all
///   predecessors of a goal state.
///   (At the beginning and the end of the pred array, there are dummy
///   entries.)
/// - `succ`: transitions grouped by source state and bunch, to allow finding
///   all successors of a source state.  Given a transition in this array, it
///   is easy to find all transitions from the same source state in the same
///   bunch.
///   (At the beginning and the end of the succ array, there are dummy
///   entries.)
/// - `action_block`: a permutation of the transitions such that transitions
///   in the same bunch are adjacent, and within each bunch transitions with
///   the same action label and target block.
///   (Between two action_block-slices with different actions, there is a dummy
///   entry.)
/// - `block_bunch`: a permutation of the transitions such that transitions
///   from the same block in the same bunch are adjacent.
///   (At the beginning of the block_bunch array, there is a dummy entry.)
/// Entries in these four arrays are linked with each other with circular
/// iterators, so that one can find the corresponding entry in another array.
///
/// Within this sort order, inert transitions are always placed after non-inert
/// transitions.
///
/// state_info_entry and block_t (defined above) contain pointers to the slices
/// of these arrays.  For bunches and block_bunch-slices, we additionally
/// create _descriptors_ that hold some information about the slice.

    /// \brief Split a block according to a splitter
    /// \details The function splits `block_B` into the R-subblock (states
    /// with a transition in `splitter_T`) and the U-subblock (states without a
    /// transition in `splitter_T`).  Depending on `mode`, the states are
    /// primed as follows:
    ///
    /// - If `mode == extend_from_marked_states`, then all states with strong
    ///   transition(s) must have been marked already.
    /// - If `mode == extend_from_marked_states__add_new_noninert_to_splitter`,
    ///   states are marked as above.  The only difference is the handling of
    ///   new non-inert transitions.
    /// - If `mode == extend_from_splitter`, then no states must be marked;
    ///   the initial states with a transition in `splitter_T` are searched by
    ///   `split()` itself.  Every bottom state with strong transition(s)
    ///   needs to have at least one marked strong transition.
    ///
    /// The  function  will  also  adapt  all  data  structures  and  determine
    /// which  transitions  have  changed  from  inert  to  non-inert.   States
    /// with  a  new  non-inert  transition  will  be  marked  upon  returning.
    /// Normally,  the  new  non-inert  transitions  are  moved  to  a  new
    /// bunch,  which  will  be  specially  created.   However,  if  `mode ==
    /// extend_from_marked_states__add_new_noninert_to_splitter`, then the new
    /// non-inert transitions will be added to `splitter_T` (which must hold
    /// transitions that have just become non-inert before this call to
    /// `split()`).  If the resulting block contains marked states, the caller
    /// has to call `handle_new_noninert_transns()` to stabilise the block
    /// because the new bunch may make the block unstable.
    /// \param block_B     block that needs to be refined
    /// \param splitter_T  transition set that makes the block unstable
    /// \param mode        indicates how to find states with a transition in
    ///                    `splitter_T`, as described above
    /// \returns (a pointer to) the R-subblock.  It is an error to call the
    /// function with settings that lead to an empty R-subblock.  (An empty
