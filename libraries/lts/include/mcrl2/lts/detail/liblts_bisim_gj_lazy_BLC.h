///
/// \brief O(m log n)-time branching bisimulation algorithm with lazy evaluation of BLC sets
/// \details This algorithm is similar to `liblts_bisim_dnj.h` and
/// `liblts_bisim_gj.h`.  In the latter algorithm, it turned out that using BLC
/// sets is rather slow; in particular, the initial partition is better
/// constructed without maintaining BLC sets.  This algorithm pushes the idea
/// further and tries to refine BLC sets as little as possible.  They are
/// replaced by super-BLC sets, which contain transitions from a union of
/// blocks, with one action label, to one constellation.  Only if a
/// single-block BLC set is required, the union of blocks is refined.  This may
/// happen only in the following two situations:
/// - when a block is refined under a large splitter, and the coroutines
///   AvoidLrg and NewBotSt are the only ones to still run.  In this situation,
///   the coroutine for NewBotSt has to go through the large splitter to find
///   states that should *NOT* go into AvoidLrg.  NewBotSt should, however,
///   only spend time on transitions that start in the current block, so a
///   single-source BLC set is required.
/// - when `four_way_splitB()` finds new bottom states and NewBotSt is large.
///   Then, NewBotSt needs to be stabilized under all its outgoing transitions,
///   but because it is large, we cannot just go through all these transitions;
///   we are only allowed to go through the transitions starting in new bottom
///   states.  However, there may be BLC sets that only have transitions from
///   non-bottom states, and to find these, we need the list of single-source
///   BLC sets for this block.
/// These situations do not occur for strong bisimulation, so no BLC sets need
/// to be constructed in that case.
///
/// A disadvantage of this version may be that it is more difficult to estimate
/// the number of transitions (for a progress message).  The reason is that
/// the earlier algorithm (in `liblts_bisim_gj.h`) used the number of BLC sets
/// as a lower bound of the number of transitions, but with super-BLC sets
/// this would not be very informative.  This file provides an option (the
/// preprocessor constant `MORE_STATISTICS`) to include an estimate of the
/// number of transitions, based on a sample state.  That means that in every
/// block, one state is picked, and its outgoing transitions are used as an
/// estimate how many transitions this block / equivalence class will have in
/// the quotient.  This method takes more effort -- enabling the option may
/// reduce the running time by 5–10%.  Therefore it is provided as an option,
/// not always enabled.
