/// \brief helper macros for coroutines
///
/// \details The following macros are intended to be used for **coroutines**
/// that are executed in _lockstep,_ i. e. both routines do (approximately) the
/// same amount of work until one of them terminates successfully.  The macros
/// are suitable for coroutines that are member methods of a class.
///
/// First, the coroutine has to be _declared_ (if it is a class method, the
/// declaration is in the body of the class).  One writes:
///
///     DECLARE_COROUTINE(function name, formal parameters,
///                 local variables, shared data type, shared variable name,
///                 interrupt locations);
///
/// Later (outside the class body), one can _define_ the coroutine, i. e. give
/// its function body.  This is written as:
///
///     DEFINE_COROUTINE(namespace, function name, formal parameters,
///                 local variables, shared data type, shared variable name,
///                 interrupt locations)
///     {
///         function body;
///     } END_COROUTINE
///
/// The  declaration  and  definition  must  have  the  same  parameter
/// list  (except  for  the  namespace).    The  formal  parameters  and
/// the  local  variables  are  given  as  a  so-called  boost  sequence:
/// `((type1, var1)) ((type2, var2)) ((type3, var3))`  etc.    In  the
/// coroutine,  parameters  and  variables  can  be  accessed  normally.
/// The  interrupt  locations  are  a  similar  (but  simpler)  boost
/// sequence:  `(location1) (location2) (location3)`  etc.
/// The macros assume that there is at least one parameter, at least one
/// local variable and at least one interrupt location.
///
/// Local variables also must be declared/defined using the macro because if
/// one coroutine is interrupted, its local variables have to be stored
/// temporarily until it resumes.
///
/// There is one shared parameter for communication between the coroutines.  If
/// one needs more than one shared parameter, a class or struct holding all
/// shared parameters has to be defined.  Both coroutines will access the same
/// shared variable.
///
/// Use the `namespace` parameter in the coroutine definition to indicate the
/// name of the class of which it is part. Include a final `::`.
///
/// Interrupt locations are places where a unit of work is counted and the
/// coroutine may be interrupted (to allow the other coroutine to work).  As
/// code without loops always incurs the same time complexity, only loop
/// statements need to be counted.  There are three commands to create a loop
/// whose iterations are counted, closely corresponding to ``normal'' loops:
///
///     COROUTINE_WHILE(interrupt location, condition)  while (condition)
///     {                                               {
///         loop body;                                      loop body;
///     }                                               }
///     END_COROUTINE_WHILE;
///
///     COROUTINE_FOR(interrupt location,               for (initialisation;
///             initialisation, condition, update)          condition; update)
///     {                                               {
///         loop body;                                      loop body;
///     }                                               }
///     END_COROUTINE_FOR;
///
///     COROUTINE_DO_WHILE(interrupt locatn,condition)  do
///     {                                               {
///         loop body;                                      loop body;
///     }                                               }
///     END_COROUTINE_DO_WHILE;                         while (condition);
///
/// These macros hide some code that counts how many iterations have been
/// executed in a loop at the end of each iteration;  if one coroutine has done
/// enough work, it is interrupted to let the other catch up (except at the end
/// of the last iteration).  That means that no work is counted if the loop
/// body is executed at most once;  so if there are multiple nested loops it is
/// not enough to let only the innermost loop count work.  It is assumed that a
/// coroutine does at most `SIZE_MAX + 1` units of work.
///
/// A coroutine may also terminate explicitly by executing the statement
/// `TERMINATE_COROUTINE_SUCCESSFULLY();`.  If it should no longer execute but
/// has not terminated successfully, it may call `ABORT_THIS_COROUTINE();`.
/// If it does no longer allow the other coroutine to run up, it may indicate
/// so by calling `ABORT_OTHER_COROUTINE();`.
///
/// A pair of coroutines is called using the macro `RUN_COROUTINES`.  This
/// macro takes two coroutine names, two actual parameter lists, and two
/// ``final'' statements:
///
///     RUN_COROUTINES(function name 1, (actual parameters), final statement 1,
///                    function name 2, (actual parameters), final statement 2,
///                    shared data type, (shared data initialiser));
///
/// It initialises the shared data with the indicated initialiser (in
/// parentheses); then, it starts the two coroutines and makes sure that they
/// do (approximately) the same amount of work.  As soon as the first one
/// terminates, its associated final statement is executed and `RUN_COROUTINES`
/// terminates.
///
/// ``Approximately the same amount of work'' is defined as:  The difference
/// between the number of steps taken by the two coroutines (i. e. the balance
/// of work) always is between -1 and +1.
