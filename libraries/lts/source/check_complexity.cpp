///
/// \brief helper class for time complexity checks during test runs
///
/// \details We use the class in this file to check whether the overall time
/// complexity fits in O(m log n).  Although it is difficult to test this in
/// general because of the constant factor in the definition of the O()
/// notation, it is often possible to give a (rather tight) upper bound on the
/// number of iterations of most loops.
///
/// The principle of time measurement with this file is:  the work done in
/// every loop body is assigned to a state or a transition.  Every state and
/// every transition gets a counter for every loop body which is assigned
/// to it.  When the loop body is executed, the corresponding counter is
/// increased.  When increasing a counter, a new value is assigned, based on
/// the logarithm of the size of the corresponding block (or constellation).
/// If the new value is not actually larger than the old one, an error is
/// raised.  The new value never is allowed to become larger than log2(n), so
/// we have:  For every counter, its value is increased at most log2(n) times,
/// and therefore no more than log2(n) steps (of a certain kind) can be
/// assigned to any single state or transition.
///
/// Note that an ``increase'' is by at least 1, but it may be more than 1.  If
/// one always increases to the maximal allowed value, it is ensured that a
/// very small block found early will only incur work that corresponds to its
/// own size (and not to the size of the block from which it was split off).
///
/// To assign work to some unit, write `mCRL2complexity(unit, add_work(counter
/// type, new counter value));`  The `unit` is a state or transition;  the
/// `counter type` is a value of `enum check_complexity::counter_type` defined
/// below; the `new counter value` typically is `check_complexity::log_n -
/// check_complexity::ilog2(block size)`.
///
/// For coroutines, there is an additional provision: work can temporarily be
/// recorded in some special counters.  As soon as it becomes clear which
/// coroutine (the one handling red states or the one handling blue states, in
/// our case) is faster, its counters are transferred to normal counters and
/// the counters of the other coroutine are cancelled.  It is checked that not
/// too many counters are cancelled.
///
/// To transfer work from a temporary to a normal counter, one uses
/// `finalise_work()`.  To cancel counters, use `cancel_work()`.  These
/// functions are not normally called directly, but through `red_is_smaller()`
/// or `blue_is_smaller()`:  If the red subblock is smaller, call
/// `red_is_smaller(temporary counter, normal counter, new counter value)` for
/// each state and each transition of the block that was refined;  if the blue
/// subblock is smaller, call `blue_is_smaller(...)`.
/// After all temporary work has been handled, call `check_temporary_work()` to
/// compare the amount of sensible work with the amount of cancelled work.
///
/// If the work could be assigned to one of several counters, I recommend to
/// assign it to all of them;  otherwise, it may happen that a later excess of
/// the time budget goes unnoticed because too few counters were advanced.
/// This, however, poses some difficulties when using temporary counters: a
/// single unit of work should be assigned to multiple counters, but added to
/// the balance between sensible and superfluous work only once.  A variant of
/// `add_work()`, namely `add_work_notemporary()`, can be called in that case:
/// it assigns a special value `DONT_COUNT_TEMPORARY` to a temporary counter
/// meaning that it should be disregarded in the calculation of the balance.
