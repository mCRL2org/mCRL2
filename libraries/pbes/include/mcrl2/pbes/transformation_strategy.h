  // and variables that do not occur somewhere. When generating
  // a rhs, optimize this rhs as in "optimize". If the rhs is
  // equal to T or F, substitute this value throughout the
  // equation system, and maintain which variables become unused
  // by doing so, as these do not have to be investigated further.
  // E.g. if a rhs is  X1 && X2, X1 does not occur elsewhere and
  // X2 turns out to be equal to false, then X1 is moved to the
  // set of irrelevant variables, and not investigated further.
  on_the_fly_with_fixed_points
  // Do the same as with on the fly, but for each generated variable
  // in the rhs, investigate whether this variable lies on a loop
  // such that depending on its fixed point, it can be set to true
  // or false. Due to the breadth first nature of the main algorithm
  // the existence of such loops must be investigated separately
  // for each variable, which can take a lot of time.
