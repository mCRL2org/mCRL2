Release and packaging procedure
===============================

Versioning scheme
-----------------

mCRL2 version numbers are standardised to three fields: ``YYYYMM.B.HHHHH``.
Here ``YYYY`` is the year, ``MM`` the month of the last release. ``B`` is the
bugfix number. ``B = 0`` for the planned (initial) release of a version.
``HHHHH`` is the Git commit hash.

For an official release, the tools will show the version ``YYYYMM.B``,
development versions will show all three fields. This enables quick
identification of the version you are dealing with by inspecting the output of
:option:`--version`. When the toolset is built from a Git clone with
modified sources, the commit hash is appended with ``M``, such that the
:option:`--version` output shows that the checkout was not clean.

Version numbers are computed in :file:`scripts/MCRL2Version.cmake`. This is the
*only* place where the main version (``YYYYMM.B``) can be defined. The rest of
the source code *should not* contain hardcoded version numbers.

Creating an official release
----------------------------

This section discusses the steps that need to be taken for creating an official
mCRL2 release. Below, the version number ``YYYYMM.B`` should be replaced
everywhere according to the scheme described above.

Creating release branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step to take is creating a release branch from ``master`` once
master is deemed stable::

  $ git branch release-YYYYMM.B
  $ git checkout release-YYYYMM.B
  $ git push origin release-YYYYMM.B

Testing
^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   Before starting with testing, make sure that there is no other mCRL2
   installation in your ``PATH``!

For all testing, we assume that the release branch is checked out in ``/tmp``::

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2.git -b release-YYYYMM.B /tmp/mcrl2-release

Before the actual release is tagged, the release branch must be tested on all
supported platforms::

* Windows 64-bit
* Ubuntu 32-bit
* Ubuntu 64-bit
* Fedora 64-bit
* Mac OS X 32-bit
* Mac OS X 64-bit


Testing is done by running (a platform specific variation of)::

  $ mkdir mcrl2-release-build
  $ cd mcrl2-release-build
  $ cmake ../mcrl2-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/tmp/mcrl2-release-build/install" \
                           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_TEST_TARGETS="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_DEPRECATED="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_RELEASE_TEST_TARGETS="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_RANDOM_TEST_TARGETS="ON"
  $ make install
  $ ctest
  $ mkdir mcrl2-debug-build
  $ cd mcrl2-debug-build
  $ cmake ../mcrl2-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/tmp/mcrl2-debug-build/install" \
                           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_TEST_TARGETS="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_DEPRECATED="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_RELEASE_TEST_TARGETS="ON" \
                           -DMCRL2_ENABLE_RANDOM_TEST_TARGETS="ON"
  $ make install
  $ ctest



Furthermore, integration with LTSmin must be tested on Linux:

*LTSmin support*

  Run the following commands::

    $ mkdir /tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build
    $ cd /tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build
    $ cmake ../mcrl2-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build/install"
    $ make install
    $ cd /tmp
    $ git clone http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/scm/ltsmin.git ltsmin
    $ cd ltsmin
    $ git checkout -b main origin/maint
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ ./ltsminreconf
    $ ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --with-mcrl2=/tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build/install --prefix=/tmp/ltsmin/install
    $ make install
    $ /tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build/install/bin/mcrl22lps /tmp/mcrl2-release/examples/academic/abp/abp.mcrl2 abp.lps
    $ export PATH=/tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build/install/bin:$PATH
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/mcrl2-ltsmin-build/install/lib/mcrl2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ /tmp/ltsmin/install/bin/lps2lts-mc abp.lps
    $ /tmp/ltsmin/install/bin/lps2lts-sym abp.lps
    $ /tmp/ltsmin/install/bin/lps2lts-dist abp.lps

Updating release number and copyright information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update the version number in the file
  ``scripts/MCRL2Version.cmake`` by updating the value assigned to the CMake
  variable ``MCRL2_MAJOR_VERSION``.

* Update the copyright period in the file ``COPYING``.

* In ``doc/sphinx/source/user_manual/historic_releases.rst``, add the previous
  release.

* Commit the changes to both ``release-YYYYMM.B`` and ``master``.

Tagging
^^^^^^^

Once the above procedure has been carried out, and all test have succeeded,
it is time to tag the release. This can be done using the interface of Github,
where a new tag can be created while making a release.

Source release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source package for the mCRL2 release is generated as follows::

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2.git -b mcrl2-YYYYMM.B sources
  $ mkdir mcrl2-package
  $ cd mcrl2-package
  $ cmake ../sources -DMCRL2_PACKAGE_RELEASE="ON"
  $ make package_source

Upload the source package::

  $ scp mcrl2-VERSION.tar.gz mcrl2@linux2.webhosting.tue.nl:www/download/release

Debian/Ubuntu packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debian packages can be built using the script in ``build/make_release``. This
requires an account on Launchpad. Note that a failed upload requires the version
number to be increased, so proper testing of the package is required before
attempting to upload it.

Windows installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, clone ``mcrl2-VERSION`` using a Git client, assume to
``mcrl2-VERSION``.

The following commands can be run in a Visual Studio x64 native command prompt
(available via the start menu) to build the package on 64-bit Windows.
We assume that CMake and Git binaries are available in the path::

  mkdir package
  cd package
  cmake ..\mcrl2-VERSION -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" -DMCRL2_PACKAGE_RELEASE=ON
  make -j8
  cpack -G NSIS

Upload the installer that has been generated to
``http://www.mcrl2.org/download/release``.

Mac OS-X installer for 10.5+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First check out ``tags/mcrl2-VERSION`` using a Git client, assume to
``mcrl2-VERSION``. It is desirable to compile with the newest version of Qt to
avoid bugs.

Configure cmake::

  $ cmake . -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET={SDK version (e.g. '10.9')} \
            -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT={/Path/To/SDK} \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ \
            -DMCRL2_PACKAGE_RELEASE=ON

Build the toolset::

  $ make

Create the DMG-installer::

  $ cpack -G DragNDrop

Upload the disk image that has been generated to
``http://www.mcrl2.org/download/release``.

Checking the installers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Double check the installers that have been built, as well as a build from
the source tarball succeeds!
