# Symbolic library

The symbolic library contains the implementation of LDD helper functions and tne
symbolic solving algorithms. The symbolic instantiation and solving algorithms
themselves are located in the `pbes` and `lps` libraries respectively since
these depend on the PBES and LPS data structures respectively.
