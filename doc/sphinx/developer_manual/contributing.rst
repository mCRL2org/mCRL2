Contributing
==================

This page describes how to contribute to the mCRL2 toolset. To contribute by means
of reporting issues see our `issue tracker <https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2/issues>`_.

Contributions such as bug fixes, additional features or even fixing issues
in the documentation can not be submitted directly to the official `repository <https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2>`_
because of lacking write-access. However, these changes can be made in a mirror
of the repository. On Github such a mirror is called a `fork`. The changes in a 
fork can be requested to pulled back into our repository by means of a `pull request`. This
pull request will be reviewed by one of the developers who will provide feedback
and potentially incorporate the change back into the official repository.

For information on creating a pull request from a fork see the corresponding Github 
`documentation <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_.
To ensure that a pull request can be merged with minimal effort the contributor
should make sure that it has no merge conflicts. The pull request should also be
based of the `master` branch (which is cloned by default), because that branch is used
for the latest development changes.

For additional information about our internal workflow see the developer documentation.
