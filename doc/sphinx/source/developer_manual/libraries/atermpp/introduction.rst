The `atermpp` library is a C++ wrapper around the ATerm Library, which is a C library for
manipulating tree-like data structures. Important features of the ATerm Library are maximal
subterm sharing, automatic garbage collection, and an efficient binary exchange format.
The purpose of the `atermpp` library is to provide the user with a common C++ interface,
and to make the ATerm Library compatible with the C++ Standard Library. It also relieves
the user from memory bookkeeping tasks. Finally it contains some search and replace
algorithms on ATerms.
