The input format of a labelled transition system can either be .aut, .lts or
.fsm. The following information about the LTS is shown:
 
* number of states.
* number of different action labels.
* number of transitions.
* whether and how many state labels there are.
* whether the transition system has probabilistic states.

Furthermore, it is reported whether
all states are reachable and wheter the lts is deterministic.
