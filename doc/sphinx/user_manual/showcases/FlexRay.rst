The FlexRay protocol is an automotive communication standard, which was designed
to be reliable and time-triggered to support safety-critical applications in a
car. A part of the controller was modelled using mCRL2 (adapted slightly to
incorporate a notion of inheritance), and it was checked whether the start-up
sequence always leads to a successfully communicating network, even if one node
misbehaves. This is not the case. Resulting error traces were visualised as shown
below.

Technical details
-----------------
The parts of the Protocol Operation Control (POC) process of the FlexRay controller
that are involved in the start-up protocol were modelled in full detail. For
components other than the POC, more abstract models were introduced. Verification
was then carried out for a 3-node network. The largest state space that was
considered had around 26 million states and 76 million transitions.
