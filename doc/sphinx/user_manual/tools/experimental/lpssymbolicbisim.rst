lpssymbolicbisim
================

This tool is aimed at generating the reachable part of the bisimulation quotient
of systems with an infinite state space. Classical state-space enumeration, such
as implemented in :ref:`tool-lps2lts`, relies on enumeration and stores each
state explicitly. To avoid this, lpssymbolicbisim applies symbolic techniques to
represent infinite sets.

To run this tool, the Z3 SMT-solver should be installed and its bin-directory
has to be added to the PATH variable.

Limitations
-----------
The tool can only deal with specifications of limited complexity. Furthermore,
there are several other restrictions:

- The tool cannot deal very well with actions that have data parameters. Actions
  with Boolean parameters will not lead to a large slowdown, but for larger
  domains, scalability will be an issue.

In any case, :ref:`tool-pbessymbolicbisim` is probably more powerful, since its
abstractions can also rely on the information of the property being checked and
it does not have to deal with actions and their parameters.
