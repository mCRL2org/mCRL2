==========

Convert Boolean equation systems (BESs) from and to different formats.
Optionally, a minimisation method can be selected that is applied on the input.

The reductions that can be done are either strong bisimulation reduction or stuttering bisimulation reduction.

Strong bisimulation reduction of BESs is described in [KW11]_. Correctness of stuttering equivalence for BESs follows from the corresponding results on parity games in [CKW11]_
