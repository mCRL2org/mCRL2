=============

Construct a PBES that expresses whether the two LPSs given as input are equal
modulo some behavioural equivalence relation specified with option `-b/--bisimulation`.
The two LPSs used to construct the PBES are equivalent if and only if the
solution to the PBES is true.

A precise definition of the construction of the PBES can be found in [CBPW07]_.
