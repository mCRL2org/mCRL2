=====

The tool :ref:`tool-lpspp` is intended to pretty print linear process
specifications in a human readable form. It has an option to print a linear
process in internal aterm format, but this is for deep debugging purposes only.
The textual output of lpspp can be re-encoded by :ref:`tool-txt2lps`. If no
input and output filenames are given,  it reads from standard input and writes
to standard output.
