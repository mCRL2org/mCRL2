========

This tool can read parameterised Boolean equation systems in textual format and
store them in the aterm format that is used by most of the tools. This tool
performs the inverse operation of :ref:`tool-pbespp`. When the argument for the
output location is omitted, the tool prints to stdout. When both the arguments
for input and output locations are omitted, the tool reads from stdin and writes
to stdout.
