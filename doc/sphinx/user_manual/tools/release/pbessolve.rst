pbessolve
=========

The tool ``pbessolve`` can solve a PBES. The solution is printed as ``true`` or ``false`` on
the command line output. If the property encoded in the PBES holds, in addition a witness can be constructed,
and if the property does not hold a counter example can be constructed. We refer to the witness or counter
example as the *evidence* of a property.

If the PBES was constructed via ``lps2pbes``, then the evidence is an LPS that is a submodel of the
LPS that was passed to ``lps2pbes``. If the PBES was constructed via ``lts2pbes``, then the evidence
is an LTS that is a submodel of the LTS that was passed to ``lts2pbes``. The evidence is written to a
file named ``<<pbesfile>>.evidence.lps`` or ``<<pbesfile>>.evidence.lts``. A different name can be
specified using the command line option `--evidence-file`.

A counter example for the "infinitely often enabled then infinitely often taken" property of the ABP protocol
can be generated as follows::

   mcrl22lps abp.mcrl2 abp.lps
   lps2pbes -v -c -f infinitely_often_enabled_then_infinitely_often_taken.mcf abp.lps abp.pbes
   pbessolve -v --file=abp.lps abp.pbes
   lps2lts abp.pbes.evidence.lps abp.pbes.evidence.lts
   ltsgraph abp.pbes.evidence.lts

Note that ``lps2pbes`` is called with the option `-c` to include counter example
information in the generated PBES. Also note that the specification ``abp.lps`` that was used
to create the PBES is passed as an argument to pbessolve with the option `--file`. It
is needed to construct the counter example. Furthermore, the counter example information is
encoded into the PBES using special PBES variables, whose structure must be preserved *exactly* by
transformations applied to the PBES. In particular, transformations such as `pbesparelm` create a 
PBES that is no longer suitable for counter example generation.

If the instantiation of the PBES takes too much time or is too large to fit in
main memory an alternative solving technique that uses symbolic
representations based on decision diagrams can be utilised, which is implemented
in the tool :ref:`tool-pbessolvesymbolic`.

Similarly it can be done starting from an LTS instead of an LPS::

   mcrl22lps abp.mcrl2 abp.lps
   lps2lts abp.lps abp.lts
   lts2pbes -v -c -f infinitely_often_enabled_then_infinitely_often_taken.mcf abp.lts abp.pbes
   pbessolve -v --file=abp.lts abp.pbes
   ltsgraph abp.pbes.evidence.lts

.. note::

   The interface of pbessolve is not stable yet. In particular the strategies that
   are available through the option `-s` are subject to change.
