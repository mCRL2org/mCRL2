bespp
=====

This tool is intended to pretty print Boolean equation systems in a human
readable form. It has an option to print a BES in internal aterm format, but
this is for deep debugging purposes only. When the argument for the output
location is omitted, the tool prints to stdout. When both the arguments for
input and output locations are omitted, the tool reads from stdin and writes to
stdout.
