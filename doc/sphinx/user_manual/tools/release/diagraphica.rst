diagraphica
===========

The diagraphica tool offers multivariate state visualization and simulation
analysis techniques for labelled transition systems (LTS's).

In the analysis mode, the tool allows the user to cluster states based on
selected attributes. The clusters are visualized in a hierarchical pyramid
structure were transitions between clusters are shown by arcs. The simulation
view gives the user the facility to navigate through the transition graph and
shows the effect of actions on the configuration. The integrated edit mode
allows the user to create such a configuration. A configuration consists of
geometric shapes. Each of the different shapes have a number of geometric and
non-geometric degree of freedoms that can be adjusted for simulation purposes.

A more elaborate description can be found in [PW07]_.
