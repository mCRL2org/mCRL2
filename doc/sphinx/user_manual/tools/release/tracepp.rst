tracepp
=======

The tool :ref:`tool-tracepp` pretty prints the content  of a trace file in
various human readable output formats. A proviso is that the requested
information, especially information about state vectors, must be present in the
trace. If no  explicit input trace file is given, input is read from stdin.
