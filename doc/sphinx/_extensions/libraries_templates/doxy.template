# the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, C#, C, C++, D, PHP, 
# Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make doxygen treat

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum 
# is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So 
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct 
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
