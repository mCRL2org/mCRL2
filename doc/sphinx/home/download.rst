Stable releases for Arch Linux are available via the `Arch User Repository <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mcrl2/>`_.
This package is currently maintained by Kevin Jilissen.

.. warning::
   On macOS Silicon (ARM64), the mCRL2 app must be manually signed by executing the following command, assuming that it is located in the `/Applications/` directory::

   $ sudo codesign --force --deep -s - /Applications/mCRL2.app

.. warning::

   On Windows, mCRL2 tools occasionally get stuck trying to read .aut files. This has been resolved in later Nightly builds.
   

Nightly build
