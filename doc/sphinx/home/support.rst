Support
=======

If the documentation pages are unsufficient to find an answer for your question then there are several ways to get support:

- General questions can either be asked on our `Github Discussions <https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2/discussions>`_.
- Alternatively, an email can be send to the main contact point Jan Friso Groote
  (j.f.groote (at) tue.nl) or the main developer Maurice Laveaux (m.laveaux (at)
  tue.nl).
- If you think you have found a bug in our tools, you are welcome to
  submit a bug at our `issue tracker <https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2/issues>`_.

.. important::

   When posting questions or reporting bugs, please describe your problem as
   clearly as possible and try to provide as much relevant information as you
   can. This greatly helps the mCRL2 team in trying to solve your problem.
