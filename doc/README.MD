# Documentation

This directory contains both the documentation of the toolset, which is presented our [website](mcrl2.org). We use [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to extract the code documentation from the C++ sources as HTML pages, which can be viewed [here](https://mcrl2.org/web/doxygen/index.html), and use a custom theme that is stored in `doxygen-awesome-css`. Furthermore, we use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) to extend this C++ reference documentation with user manuals, developer and maintainer documentation written in [ReStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) and [Myst](https://mystmd.org/) Markdown.

## Building the documentation

In the cmake configuration the build flag `MCRL2_ENABLE_DOC` will introduce the `doc` target that will run the Sphinx build to show the HTML pages in `sphinx/build` of the configured build directory. The option `MCRL2_ENABLE_DOC_PDFLATEX` will extend the documentation with pdfs generated from `.tex` files automatically, implemented by the `:mcrl2_pdflatex:` role. And the option `MCRL2_ENABLE_DOC_MANUAL` will introduce the `:mcrl2_manual:` directive that generates the man page from the selected tool and generates a corresponding HTML page. Finally, the option `MCRL2_ENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN` will add a target `doxygen` that will use `doxygen` to build the reference documentation, and instruct sphinx to resolve references to the doxygen output using `doxylink`. Building the documentation requires the python libraries from `requirements.txt` to be installed, and furthermore a LaTeX distribution to translate the `math` directives. These `math` directives furthermore use the tool `dvisvgm` to translate the result into SVG files that are then displayed on the resulting webpage.
