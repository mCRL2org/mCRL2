µCRL was used in the analysis of a real-life system for lifting trucks (lorries,
railway carriages, buses and other vehicles). The system consists of a number of
lifts; each lift supports one wheel of the truck that is being lifted and has
its own microcontroller. The controls of the different lifts are connected by
means of a cyclical network. A special purpose protocol has been developed to
let the lifts operate synchronously. Four errors were found in the original
design. A solution to these problems was proposed and it was shown by means of
model checking that the modified system meets the requirements.

Technical details
-----------------

Two safety, two liveness properties and deadlock freedom were checked.

*Type of verification*
  Deadlock and safety properties violations detection by explicit state-space
  generation (breadth-first search). CADP toolset was used to model-check the
  properties formulated in regular alternation-free modal µ-calculus.

*Equipment (computers, CPU, RAM)*

*Models*
  The model is available as a part of the µCRL Toolset. A translation of this
  model to mCRL2, performed by Bas Ploeger, is distributed with the mCRL2
  Toolset.
