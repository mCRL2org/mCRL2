Build instructions
==================

The mCRL2 source code can be obtained in two ways. The source code for releases
of the toolset are available as a source tarball, see :ref:`download`. The source
code for the development version of the toolset is available in our `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
repository hosted at `Github <https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2>`_. It can be
obtained using:

  git clone https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2.git

In the remainder of this manual, we assume that you have the source code on
your system in a folder called ``mcrl2/src``. We will set up an out-of-source
build in ``mcrl2/build``, with a staging directory in ``mcrl2/stage``.
