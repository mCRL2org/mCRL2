ltsinfo
=======

Print basic information on a labelled transition system.
The input format of a labelled transition system can either be .aut, .lts or
.fsm. The following information about the LTS is shown:

* number of states.
* number of different action labels.
* number of transitions.
* whether and how many state labels there are.
* whether the transition system has probabilistic states.

Furthermore, it is reported whether
all states are reachable and wheter the lts is deterministic.

For a .lts the sets of state labels can be printed using the option '''-l'''
