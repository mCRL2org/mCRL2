lts2pbes
========

The tool ``lts2pbes`` reads a modal formula as well as a labelled transitions system in .lts, .aut or
.fsm format and generates a parameterised boolean equation system (PBES) of which the solution
of the initial variable indicates whether the
formula is valid in the initial state of the transition system. The generated PBES can be solved
using tools such as :ref:`tool-pbes2bool`, :ref:`tool-pbessolve` or :ref:`tool-pbespgsolve`.

When the labelled transition file is of type .aut or .fsm, the information about data types and
actions is not available and must be provided explicitly using the ``--data``, ``--lps``, or
``--mcrl2`` flag. A .lts file contains such information.

When using particular formulas, for instance such as::

   [true*]<a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h>true

then the standard translation to PBESs can yield a very PBES which is very elaborate to generate and can
become large. This is due to the fact
that the subformula ``<a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h>`` is translated into one PBES equation with a huge right hand side.
This right hand side essentially reflects for any state of the lts whether a trace ``a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h`` is possible.
When using the flag ``--preprocess-modal-operators`` the formula is first transformed into the equivalent
formula::

   [true*]mu X1.<a>mu X2.<b>mu X3.<c>mu X4.<d>mu X5.<d>mu X6.<e>mu X7.<f>mu X8.<g>mu X9.<h>true

This formula replaces the single very large equation by 9 ones, where the right hand sides only contain
the information whether a single action can be done. This is generally faster and yields a substantially
smaller PBES.

The tool :ref:`tool-pbessolve` is capable of generating a counter example in the form of labelled transition systems,
provided the PBES is generated
using lts2pbes (or :ref:`tool-lps2pbes`) using the ``--counter-example`` flag. The generated PBES is more complicated
and may be harder to solve. Yet, these counter examples are very helpful in determining whether formulas do
not hold. If formulas are valid, this flag can also be used to determine witnesses, i.e., evidence when formulas
are valid. The tool :ref:`tool-pbes2bool` can generate counter examples without the use of this flag. These
counter-examples are solely based on the provided PBES and they must be manually be related to the original
transition system.
