txt2lps
=======

This tool can read linear process specifications in textual format and store
them in the aterm format that is used by most of the tools. This tool performs
the inverse operation of :ref:`tool-lpspp`. When the argument for the output
location is omitted, the tool prints to stdout. When both the arguments for
input and output locations are omitted, the tool reads from stdin and writes to
stdout.
