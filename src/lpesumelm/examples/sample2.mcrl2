% lpesumelm Test Case 2 -- sum variable equal to constant in condition,
% the sum variable is used as time
%
% The sum variable y is equal to 4 in the condition, hence 4 should be
% substituted for y in the time arguments of the actions. Furthermore 4==y
% should be removed from the condition, and sum y should be removed.
act a,b;

proc X = sum y:Int . (4==y) -> a@y . b@(y+1) . X;
