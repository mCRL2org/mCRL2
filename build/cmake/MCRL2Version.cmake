# MCRL2Version.cmake
#
# This script defines the version information that is displayed in the tools and
# the documentation. It defines the following variables:
#
#   MCRL2_MAJOR_VERSION: The major version number. This number should be set
#     by the maintainer who releases a new version of the toolset. This version
#     number should be of the form YYYYMM.B, where YYYY is the year of the
#     release, MM the month of the release, and B the bugfix release number. For
#     a regular (scheduled) release, B should be set to 0. Example: the first
#     bugfix of the July 2011 release should be numbered 201107.1
#   MCRL2_MINOR_VERSION: This is the minor version number of the toolset, which
#     is equal to the current Git commit short-hash. A locally modified Git
#     commit will result in a MCRL2_MINOR_VERSION that ends in "M".
#   MCRL2_VERSION: The version string that should be displayed in tools. It
#     consists of MCRL2_MAJOR_VERSION and MCRL2_MINOR_VERSION for development
#     builds, and only MCRL2_MAJOR_VERSION for release builds.
#
# The script also defines one advanced option:
#
#   MCRL2_PACKAGE_RELEASE: This boolean allows you to create a release package.
#     When set, MCRL2_VERSION is changed accordingly, and extra checks are put
#     in place to prevent users from unknowingly publishing a release that can
#     not be generated from a clean Git clone.
#
# Package maintainers may set the variable below to issue a new release.
