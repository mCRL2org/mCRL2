\section{Introduction}
This \tool\ tool is a tool for the \mcrl\ studio. The tool is a
filter which reads form a \ti{input.lpe}. The file \ti{input.lpe} is
a file in \ti{.lpe} format \cite{LPEformat}. We make use of the
\framework\ to read the \ti{input.lpe}. For
each constant \pp\ The filter substitutes its constant value and removes the \pp\ from the
\lpe . After the algorithm (Section \ref{sec:alg}) terminates, \tool\
will write the output to an output file \ti{output.lpe} in the \ti{.lpe} format \cite{LPEformat}.

\section{definitions} \label{sec:def}

The equation below is a representation of a \lpe\ in \mcrl\ . This definition simplified\footnote{Multiactions and time are not taken into account} to describe the \tool\ tool.
\begin{defn}[\lpe]\label{def:LPE}
\begin{displaymath}
X (\ovr{d}:\ovr{D}) = \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{e_i:E_i} c_i ( \ovr{d}, \ovr{e_i} ) \rightarrow a(\ovr{f_i}(\ovr{d},e_i)) \cdot X(\ovr{g_i}(\ovr{d},e_i)) $$
$$ X(\ovr{init})
\end{displaymath}\\
A \lpe\ is written as in Definition \ref{def:LPE}, the different states of the process are represented by the data vector parameter $\ovr{d}:\ovr{D}$. $\ovr{D}$ may be a Cartesian product of $n$ data types, meaning that $\ovr{d}$ may consist of a tuple $(d_1, \ldots, d_n)$. The \lpe expresses that in state $\ovr{d}$ it preforms action $a$, carrying data parameter $f_i(\ovr{d},e_i)$ and it can reach the new state $g_i(\ovr{d},e_i)$ under the conditions that $c_i(\ovr{d,e_i})$ is true. So for each summand $i:I$ we have a function $g_i: D \times E \rightarrow D$ and a function $c_i: D \times E $, which reduces to a normal form \ti{true}, \ti{false} or something else. 

The data type $E$ helps to give the \lpe s a more general form. Not only the data parameter $\ovr{d}:\ovr{D}$, but also the data parameters $e_i: E_i$ can influence the condition $c_i$ and the and the resulting state $g_i$. Such a $e_i$ is often used in a \lpe to do a read or send action range over a domain. 

For an more detailed explanation of \lpe s  we refer to \cite{LPE_info}.
\end{defn}

\subsection{lpeconstelm definition}\label{subsec:lpedef}

A parameter of a \lpe\ can be replaced by its initial value if it can be determined that this parameter remains constant throughout any run of the process. The elimination of constant parameters does not reduce the resulting state space, however it may shorten the time needed tot generate a state space from a \lpe. \\
If we have infinite time and space we can inspected each state space and check if a \pp\ changes throughout the the run of the process. We define the reachability state set $R_{\psi}$ for each state, given a certain input value ($\ovr{v_0}$). So:
\begin{defn}\label{def:lpe}
$R_\psi$ is the smallest set which complies to:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\ovr{v_0} \in R_\psi(\ovr{v_0})$
\item For all $i \in I$ and $w_i \in E_i$ if $v \in R_\psi(\ovr{v_0})$ and $c_i(v, w_i$ holds, \\ then $g_i(v, w_i) \in R_\psi(\ovr{v_0})$ \\

$S_\psi(\ovr{v_0}) = \lbrace j \in  \lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace \vert \exists_u : D_j . \forall \ovr{v} \in R_\psi(\ovr{v_0}) . v_j = u \rbrace $
\end{itemize}

$S_\psi(\ovr{v_0})$ will give the set of indices in for which the \pp\ is constant. Definition \ref{def:lpe} is based upon a minimal fixed point solution. 
\end{defn}

Note that definition \ref{def:lpe} has to generate the entire statespace. Generating the entire statespace can take a lot of time and space. In some cases generating the entire statespace and checking for constants can infinite time. If we can make an approximation of definition \ref{def:lpe} by making certain assumptions, we can come up with a "faster" solution. However this set of detected constants may be smaller, because it cannot detect all constant \pps .

In our approximation proposals we define $S$:
\begin{defn}
The subset of $\lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace$, where the elements of $S$ represent the indices of $d_0, \ldots d_1$ constant \pps .
\end{defn}

\subsection{Proposal 1} \label{sec:prop1}
We do not want to inspect all statespaces, so a first approximation proposal will be:
\begin{defn} \label{def:sug1}
$S=$
\begin{displaymath}
\lbrace   
j \in \lbrace 1, \ldots , n \rbrace \vert \forall_{i\in I}, \ovr{d}: \ovr{D} , e_i: E_i, ((c_i(\ovr{d},e_i) = true)  \rightarrow d_j = g_i^j(\ovr{d},e_i)))\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
This approximation is very basic and does not cover all possible solutions. If we take example
\ref{example:sug1}, we see the lack in definition \ref{def:sug1}.
\begin{example} \label{example:sug1} The example \\
\begin{verbatim}
proc P(x : Nat) = P(x := 2 * x);
init P(x : = 0);
\end{verbatim}

\end{example}
If we fill in example \ref{example:sug1} in definition \ref{def:sug1}, this will result into $S = \o$. 
Because we indicate no $\ovr{d}$, it has to hold for each $\ovr{d}$. If we substitute $\langle x=0 \rangle$ for $d$
the result should be $S= \lbrace 1 \rbrace$. 
%For all $x / 0 $ the outcome of the \pp\ is not constant. However for $x=0$ the \pp\ is constant in this \lpe . 
%If we use $e_i$, we also have to examine the whole statespace. So we have to create another solution which is less relax then definition \ref{def:sug1}.
% { j | forall d : d=2*d }
\end{defn}

\subsection{Proposal 2}
In section \ref{sec:prop1} we see that definition \ref{def:sug1} is not sufficient, so we try to improve that approximation.
We propose:
\begin{defn} \label{def:sug2}
$S(\ovr{d}:\ovr{D})=$
\begin{displaymath}
\lbrace   
j \in \lbrace 1, \ldots , n \rbrace \vert \forall_{i\in I}, ((c_i(\ovr{d},e_i) = true) \rightarrow d_j = g_i^j(\ovr{d},e_i)))\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
%We elimate the problem for checking each state 
If we take $\ovr{d}$ out of the formula and give it as a parameter to $S$ we can instantiate a particular problem.
With this improvement to $S$ we can solve the example \ref{example:sug1}. However this this proposal, cannot as another lack. If we take a look at example \ref{example:sug2} we can see why:
\begin{example} \label{example:sug2} The example \\
\begin{verbatim} 
proc P(x,y: Nat) = (x=0) -> P(x:= 1, y:= 0) +
                   (x=1) -> P(x:= x, y:= 1);
init P(0,0);
\end{verbatim}

\end{example}
If we fill example \ref{example:sug2} into defintion \ref{def:sug2}, we get $j = \lbrace 2 \rbrace$. This indicates that the second \pp\ is constant. However this assumption is false. It seems that we only those state space spaces which are adjacent to the initial state.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Proposal 3}
We don't want to inspect all statespaces, so a solution bases upon a minimum fixed point will not do. To give
an approximation we start off with a proposal base upon a maximum fixed point. So we define: 
\begin{defn} \label{def:sug3} So we are interested in the largest subset:

\begin{flushleft}
$ S \subseteq \lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace $ \\

such that:\\

$\forall_{i \in I} NF( c_i ( \ovr{\otimes}, e_i ) ) \not\equiv false \rightarrow \forall_{j \in S}.d_j \equiv  NF( g^j(\ovr{\otimes}, e_i )) $
\end{flushleft}
 
The normal form of data parameter $p$ is defined $NF(p)$. $v_0$ is the initial \sv\ \ref{sv}. 
$\ovr{\otimes}$ is used for constructing a \ti{new} \sv\ . Let $\ovr{\otimes}$ be a \ti{new} \sv .

\begin{defn} \label{def:otimes} Let $\ovr{\otimes}$ be:
\begin{displaymath}
    \forall_{i:0<i\leqslant n}:\otimes_i = \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            i \in S                      & d_i \\
            i \not\in S                  & v_{0_i} \\
        \end{array} \right.
\end{displaymath}
\end{defn}
If we take a look at Definition \ref{def:sug3} a few modifications are made. 
Note that we introduced the normal form. The introduction is needed, because we want to 
evaluate open terms. If we rewrite a condition which contains an open term, it is possible
that the term will not reduce to a normal form \ti{true} or \ti{false}. If the term reduces to a
term that is not \ti{true} or \ti{false}, the condition might be \ti{true}. Therefore the summands of the conditions
which are \ti{false} are not inspected.

If we compare Definition \ref{def:sug3} to Definition \ref{def:LPE} we see that holds: $$S_{Def. \ref{def:sug3}} \subseteq
S_{Def. \ref{def:LPE}} $$  For each condition that holds in Definition \ref{def:sug3} there is a condition that holds in Definition \ref{def:LPE}. So for each $i$ in Definition \ref{def:sug3} there is also a $i$ in Definition \ref{def:LPE}. However for each condition that holds in Definition \ref{def:LPE} there is a might be a condition in Definition \ref{def:sug3} which does not hold. Therefore for each $i$ in Definition \ref{def:LPE} there might be no $i$ in Definition \ref{def:sug3}. Because Definition \ref{def:sug3} is based upon a maximum fixed point and Definition \ref{def:LPE} is based upon a minimum fixed point we can conclude Definition \ref{def:sug3} is correct and sufficient.

However free variables are not taken into account.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Proposal 4}
Free variables are data parameters which are not bound to \pps\ of a \lpe\ but occur in a \lpe .
\begin{defn} Let a free variable $fv$ be defined:
\begin{displaymath}
%fv = \lbrace i \vert \exist_i: i \not\in d \wedge i \in  \rbrace
\end{displaymath}
\end{defn}

%Idea proposal: \\
%Use LPE constelim, after termination, build adjacency matrix , and do cross compare on same  


\subsection{Algorithm definitions}
To calculate the set of constant \pps\ we use the algorithm
\ref{sss:alg} Before we describe the algorithm we the introduce
used definitions. 
%These definitions are defined in \ref{sss:algdef}.
%A more general explanation is given in \ref{sss:algdesc}

\begin{defn} \textbf{- state vector} \label{sv}\\
This vector represents the \pps\ of the input of a \lpe . The vector is 
$\langle d_1, \ldots, d_n \rangle$, where $n$ is the is the number
of \pps . 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} \textbf{- flag vector}\\
This vector of boolean values which represents if \pps\
are constant or variable. If an element of this vector is \ti{true}
this implies that the corresponding \pp\ is possibly constant. If an element
of this vector is \ti{false} this implies that the corresponding
\pp\ is variable.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} \textbf{- new state vector set}\\
 This set of vectors represents the result of the
\pps\ for which the normal form of the condition is not \ti{false}
\end{defn} 

\begin{defn}
\textbf{- new flag vector} \\
This vector of boolean values indicates if the
corresponding \pps\ are \ti{constant} or \ti{variable} after comparing each element from the \svs with all the other elements of \svs  and the \sv; and conjunction of the \fv and obtained result. 
%\begin{displaymath}
%\langle \cup_{i \in I}: c_i(\ovr{d, e_i}) : (\ovr{\Bbb{B}}) ) \rangle
%\end{displaymath}
\end{defn}

\subsubsection{Description}\label{sss:desc}
In this section the algorithm is explained informal. First \sv\ is constructed from the initial process of the \lpe (see \cite{LPE_info}). Next the \fv\ is "constructed".
% The number of vector elements in this vector is equal to the number of \pps . Each \pp\ corresponds with an element in the \fv .  
All elements in this vector are set \ti{true}.

We start the iteration. We rewrite and evaluated for each summand its condition. We "evaluate" the condition after substituting the values of the \pp\ from the \sv\ in the condition and rewrite it. Only those \pp\ from the \sv\ are substituted for which the corresponding element in the \fv\ is true. 

%After substitution the condition is rewritten. 
If the rewritten condition is in a normal form other then \ti{false} the condition might be \ti{true} for some instations of a contained free variable, so the summand will evaluated. 

In this step the \svs\ is constructed. This set of new state vectors contains the set of next state vectors which can be reached from the current \sv\ and for which the condition might be \ti{true}. 

After the \svs\ is constructed, we construct the \nfv . 

%Initally we set \ the size of the set to the number of non false conditions. Each element within  these vectors is set true. Each vector of the \fvs\ corresponds with a vector of \svs . Each element of a vector in the \fvs\ is a comparison between the \sv and the element of the corrresponding vector in the \svs . If a element from the vector in the \svs\ is not equal to an element out of the \sv\ , the corresponding \fvs\ element is set to false. 

%Next we construct a \ti{new} \fv . For each element in this vector we take the conjunction of all the values of the same element in the vectors of the \fvs . Each element of a vector from the \svs\ is checked if they differ from other elements  in vectors of the \svs . The boolean outcome of both results is the \ti{new} \fv . The reason for this second check is needed on the \svs , because free variables might occur. 
 
If the \nfv\ differs from the \fv , a \ti{new} \sv\ has to be created as well. The construction of the \ti{new} \sv\ contains all the elements from the \sv\ substituted with data parameters from the vectors out of the \svs which differ . 
%These can be found in the \svs . 
A next iteration is started in which the old \sv\ is substituted by the \ti{new} \sv\ and the old \fv\ is substituted by the \nfv .
  
If the \ti{new} \fv\ does not differ from the \fv\ the algorithm ends and all \pps\ which have a corresponding value true in the \fv\ are substituted by their constant values. Then these \pps list and all occurrences of \pp\ 

\subsubsection{Free variables}
In \mcrl\ it is possible to use free variables. %Free variables are values which have no particular value and can therefore be threaded as don't care values.
If a \pp\ is substituted by a free variable and the \pp\ has already got a value, the value remains the same. If a \pp\ , which is a free variable, is substituted by a variable with a specific value, the value is changed to that specific value. If a \pp , which is a free variable, is substituted by another free variable, the \pp\ remains a free variable. 

If we compare a free variable with another value, either a free variable or a specific value, the comparison always yields \ti{true}. Adding a check on the \svs\ solves the problem of the possibility of fake constants. At first this might seems strange, but is contributes to the validity of the algorithm. Let us concider example \ref{exmpl:freevar}:
\begin{example}\label{exmpl:freevar} The LPE: 
\begin{tabbing}
$P(y = \_,x = 0) =$ \= $(true) \rightarrow  P(y := x+1, x := x) + $ \\
	    \> $(true)
 \rightarrow P(y := x+2, x := x)$
\end{tabbing}

A free variable is denoted with $\_$. If we take a look at the LPE and build the \nfv\ we get:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
 $\lbrace \langle True, $ & $ True \rangle$\\
 $\langle True, $ & $ True \rangle \rbrace$\\
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

However the when we build the \svs , we get:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
 $\lbrace \langle$ 1, & 0 $\rangle$\\
 $\langle$ 2, & 0 $\rangle \rbrace$\\
\end{tabular}  
\end{center}

If we take the conjunction of the elements of each vector within the \nfv\ the \ti{new} \fv\ will be:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
 $\langle True, $ & $ True \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

However by examining the \svs\ this should be: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
 $\langle False, $ & $ True \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This why have an additional check on the \svs\ to overcome this problem.
\end{example}

\section{Examples}
This section covers a few simple examples to illustrate the behavior of the algorithm. 
\subsection{Example 1} The example \\
\begin{verbatim}
proc P(i,j: Nat) = true -> P(i:= i + 1, j:=j);
init P(i := 0, j := 0)
\end{verbatim} \footnote{\mcrl specifaction language}

Construct state vector and flag vector: 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\sv \la  $\langle 0 , 0 \rangle$\\
\fv \la  $\langle True , True \rangle$\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

Evaluate all the conditions of all summands.
The condition of the first summand is \ti{true}.\\

We constructed the \svs and the \nfv :
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\svs \la  $\lbrace \langle 1 , 0 \rangle \rbrace $\\
\nfv \la $\langle False , True \rangle $
\end{minipage}\end{center}

We compare \ti{new} \fv\ with \fv\ and see they are not equal so we continue:
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\sv \la $\langle 1 , 0 \rangle $\\
\fv \la $\langle False , True \rangle $\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

In the second iteration the condition of the first summand is \ti{true}.\\
So we construct again the \svs, the \nfv\ : 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\svs \la  $\lbrace \langle 2 , 0 \rangle \rbrace $\\
\nfv \la  $\langle False , True \rangle $ \\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

If we compare the \fv\ with \ti{new} \fv\ we see they are equal and the iteration ends.
In this example the second \pp\ (\verb"j") is substituted by \verb"0" and \verb"j" is removed from the \lpe.
After applying the filter we get:\\
\begin{verbatim}
proc P(i) = true -> P(i := i + 1);
Init P(0);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example 2}
This example shows the why iteration is needed.
\begin{verbatim}
proc P(i,j) = P(i := i + 1, j := i);
init P(i := 0, j := 0); 
\end{verbatim}
 
Construct state vector and flag vector: 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\sv \la  $\langle 0 , 0 \rangle$\\
\fv \la  $\langle True , True \rangle$\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

Evaluate all the conditions of all summands.
The condition of the first summand is \ti{true}.\\

We constructed the \svs and the \nfv :
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\svs \la  $\lbrace \langle 1 , 0 \rangle \rbrace $\\
\nfv \la  $\lbrace False , True \rbrace $\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

We compare \ti{new} \fv\ with \fv\ and see they are not equal so we continue:
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\sv \la $\langle 1 , 0 \rangle $\\
\fv \la $\langle False , True \rangle $\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

In the second iteration the condition of the first summand is \ti{true}.\\
So we construct again the \svs and the \nfv\: 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\svs \la  $\lbrace \langle 2 , 1 \rangle \rbrace $\\
\nfv \la  $\langle False , False \rangle $ \\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

We compare \ti{new} \fv\ with \fv\ and see they are not equal so we continue:
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\sv \la $\langle 2 , 1 \rangle $\\
\fv \la $\langle False , False \rangle $\\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

In the third iteration the condition of the first summand is \ti{true}.\\
So we construct again the \svs and the \nfv\ : 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{250pt}
\svs \la  $\lbrace \langle 3 , 2 \rangle \rbrace $\\
\nfv \la  $\langle False , False \rangle $ \\
\end{minipage}\end{center}

If we compare the \fv\ with \ti{new} \fv\ we see they are equal and the iteration ends.
Non of the elements in the \fv\ are \ti{true}, so there are no constants. The \lpe\ remains unchanged.
