===============================================================================
Changes between toolset releases July 2008 and January 2009:
===============================================================================

 General:
   - compatible with LTSmin toolset 1.1 van de Universiteit Twente
   - added support for importing LTSes from DOT format
   - improved mCRL2 lts storage format which now uses the .lts suffix

      Affected tools: lps2lts, ltsinfo, ltsconvert, ltscompare, ltsgraph,
      ltsview, and diagraphica

   - support for rational numbers (as part of sort Real):
     + rational numbers can be created using the division operator /
     + rational numbers can be converted to integers by means of functions
       floor, ceil and round
   - comparison operations <, <=, >= and > are now defined on all standard
     data types (including structured sorts)
   - sets and bags data structures have been reimplementated to use exception
     lists. This allows the use sets and bags in most specifications for
     generating state spaces. Up till now, sets and bags only worked properly
     with simulation. Note that we are dealing with sets and bags as the
     "infinite" mathematical object; specifying the set of all even numbers can
     easily be done....
   - numerous small improvements to tools and underlying infrastructure
   - lots of bug fixes
 
 Renamed tools:
   - formcheck is now called formulacheck

 New functionality:
   - ltsgraph is completely reimplemented and now uses OpenGL for rendering
   - ltsgraph, ltsview, diagraphica now support the input from the unified lts
     format

 New tools:
   - pbesparelm: removes unused parameters from a PBES.
   - pbesconstelm: removes constant parameters from a PBES.

===============================================================================
Changes between toolset releases January 2008 and July 2008:
===============================================================================
 
 General:
   - improved command line interfaces and help information:
     + simplified interfaces of most tools, especially mcrl22lps, lps2lts,
       lps2torx, ltscompare, ltsmin, ltsconvert, tracepp and formcheck
     + improved consistency among tools
     + adherence to the GNU standard for command line interfaces
     + removed the undocumented feature that the argument '-' can be used
       for reading from standard input in or writing to standard output
     + improved error handling of loading and saving binary files
   - added manual pages for tools
   - changed SVC library license from the
     GNU General Public License, version 2 (or newer), to the
     GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (or newer).
   - libraries and header files are installed
   - improvements to existing tool and library documentation
   - improved regression testing
   - lots of bug fixes

 Added tools:
   - txt2pbes: translates a textual PBES specification to the binary format

 Removed tools:
   - pbes2bes: most functionality is incorporated in pbes2bool
 
 Renamed tools:
   - lpsdecluster is now called lpssuminst
   - lpsformcheck is now called formcheck
 
 Performance improvements:
   - improved performance of lpspp and pbespp for specifications
     involving many variable declarations
   - improved average case performance of div and mod calculations by
     a factor of 2
   - increased power of enumeration involving conditions on list length,
     e.g. enumerating all lists l such that #l == 2 or #l <= 2
   - lpssuminst: summands with a false condition are filtered out
   - lpssumelm: more time-efficient on specifications involving large
     conditions
   - squadt: more time-efficient initialisation process
 
 New functionality:
   - ltsview: added new option for marking states: mark separately for 
     every mark rule
   - ltscompare: added comparison using simulation preorder/equivalence
   - ltsconvert: added minimisation modulo simulation equivalence
   - pbes2bool, lpsactionrename, diagraphica: functional improvements
   - lpssuminst: added (option -t/--tau) which only instantiates tau summands
   - formcheck: now also works with PBESes or without a context specification

 Notes:
   - LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release cannot be used
     anymore. They need to be regenerated using the tools in this release.
   - SQuADT specific:
     + The tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools;
       to do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory.
     + Old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
       format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
       recreated manually.

===============================================================================
Changes between toolset releases July 2007 and January 2008:
===============================================================================

 General:
   - Numerous bug fixes.
   - Added documentation for all libraries and tools on the website.

 Added tools:
   - chi2mcrl2: translates a subset of Chi to mCRL2
   - lpsactionrename: selectively renames or hides actions in linear processes
   - pbesrewr: applies the rewriter to simplify data expressions in PBESes

 Removed tools:
   - lpsdataelm (its functionality has been integrated in other tools)

 New functionality:
   - Added full support for the verification of modal formulas with data using
     lps2pbes and pbes2bool.
   - Improved handling of time in the lineariser (mcrl22lps). Sometimes this
     slows the lineariser down. Added flags to suppress time if needed.
   - Improvement of the output of the pretty printers (lpspp and pbespp) that
     print linear processes and parameterised boolean equation systems.
   - Added simulation support to ltsview and improved its layout.
   - Functionality of sim is the same as that of xsim (as far as allowed with
     a command line interface).
   - Migrated from CVC Lite to CVC3 as supported external SMT-solver.

 Notes:
   - LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release cannot be used
     anymore. They need to be regenerated using the tools in this release.
   - SQuADT specific:
     + The tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools;
       to do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory.
     + Old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
       format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
       recreated manually.
